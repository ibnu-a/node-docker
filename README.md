# Node.js Express App with Docker, Redis, CORS, and Session

Welcome to the **Node.js Express App with Docker, Redis, CORS, and Session** repository!

## Features:

1. **Express.js Framework:** The application is built on top of Express.js, a popular and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express provides a solid foundation to create APIs and web applications with ease.

2. **Docker Integration:** We have implemented Docker support in this project, allowing you to containerize your Node.js application along with all the dependencies, making it portable and easy to deploy across various environments.

3. **Redis Integration:** Redis is utilized as an in-memory data store, providing fast and efficient caching and session management capabilities. It ensures seamless user experiences and reduces database load.

4. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** CORS is configured to allow secure cross-origin requests. This feature is essential when building client-side applications that interact with the API from different domains.

5. **Session Management:** The application includes session management using Express's built-in `express-session` middleware. This enables user authentication and provides a mechanism to store user-specific data during their session.
